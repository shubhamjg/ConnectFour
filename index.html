      <h3>Connect Four Game</h3>
      <p class="game_description">
        Connect Four is a game where players take turn dropping colored <br/>
        circles in the top of the board, along different rows.  <br/>
        The goal is to make a row of 4 circles in a row - straight or diagnal.

          Divs or other HTML elements could be used too. The top row 
          (and tablehead - 'thead') is reserved for the buttons to drop the 
          game pieces.
